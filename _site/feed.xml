<p>You can easily sequence you photographs in Photoshop following <a href="https://www.creativelysquared.com/article/how-to-turn-your-image-sequence-into-a-stop-motion-video">this tutorial</a>. I would recommend using the iMacs in the classroom to do this and depending on the amount of photographs you might want to do them in batches and then combine the videos in After Effects or Premiere. </p>

<p>You will conceptualize, plan, design, and animate a motion project of your choosing.</p>

<p>Each project has a specific set of goals and requirements that should be accomplished. You will find and  generate the content that fits the description for your chosen project. If you choose to create your own project, read through these to get a feel for the scope of work required.</p>

<p>The projects you can choose from are a <a href="#kinetic">Kinetic Type Video</a>, a <a href="#title">Title Sequence</a>, or a <a href="#broadcast">Broadcast Design Package</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOGIWaYc=/?invite_link_id=252614769573">Reference Miro Board</a></p>

<h4 id="kinetic-type-video"><span id="kinetic">Kinetic Type Video</span></h4>
<p>Make a one minute or more video combining type and audio. The audio can be a song, a clip from a show or film, a speech, etc. Keep in mind that certain aspects of the audio can influence decisions you make while animating the type so make sure you are familiar with the audio. Outside shapes, colors, and lines can be used but no pictures or videos. The video should have a title scene that includes the title for the audio and who made the audio. For example, a song would have a song title and artist name and a movie scene would have the movie title and characters involved.</p>

<h5 id="requirements">Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>At least a minute long</li>
  <li>Audio treated respectfully at the beginning and end</li>
  <li>1920x1080 format</li>
  <li>Only text and paths/shapes, no outside images or video</li>
  <li>Title scene showing title of audio and maker of audio</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="checkpoints">Checkpoints</h5>
<ul>
  <li>March 10: Start</li>
  <li>March 24: Audio selected, project plan meeting</li>
  <li>March 31: Initial storyboards and 2 different concept board directions (colors, type, etc.)</li>
  <li>April 7: At least two refined concept boards and brief motion tests</li>
  <li>April 14: Title section and first section animated (at least 20 seconds)</li>
  <li>April 21: Refined beginning and continuing to animate (at least 40 seconds)</li>
  <li>April 28: Full draft (at least 60 seconds)</li>
  <li>May 5: Buffer Week</li>
  <li>May 12: Due</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="title-sequence"><span id="title">Title Sequence</span></h4>
<p>Design a title sequence for a book of your choice. The book can be any length but fiction is probably the easiest category to choose from. You cannot use any visuals associated with the book and if you pick an illustrated book you certainly cannot use the illustrations in your sequence. The book should not already be a movie and you will be responsible for generating your own cast and crew to display. Take a look at this list on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_credits#Common_opening_credits_order">Wikipedia</a> to get an idea of who you might want to display, you don’t need to display them all. The title sequence should be one minute long or more.</p>

<h5 id="requirements-1">Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>At least a minute long</li>
  <li>1920x1080 format</li>
  <li>Displays names and titles for a reasonable amount of people (probably around 10 to 15)</li>
  <li>Displays book title and based on a story by [author] at some point</li>
  <li>Uses audio</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="checkpoints-1">Checkpoints</h5>
<ul>
  <li>March 10: Start</li>
  <li>March 24: Book selected, project plan meeting</li>

  <li>April 14: First half completed (around 30 seconds)</li>
  <li>April 21: Full draft completed (at least 60 seconds)</li>
  <li>April 28: Refined full draft</li>
  <li>May 5: Buffer Week</li>
  <li>May 12: Due</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="broadcast-design-package"><span id="broadcast">Broadcast Design Package</span></h4>
<p>Design some motion pieces for a created TV station. You will curate a selection of shows the station will show, come up with a name and logo for the station, and generate a few motion pieces. There will be three pieces you will need to design for the station, an animated logo, lower thirds that introduce the show, tell what’s coming on next, or some other information, and a station lineup that shows what day and time certain shows are happening. Some broadcast design terms and some examples you can find <a href="https://motionarray.com/learn/motion-design/broadcast-design-terms/">here</a>.</p>

<h5 id="requirements-2">Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Station name and logo</li>
  <li>Single video at 1920x1080 that includes all the specific parts with titles introducing each part</li>
  <li>Animated logo (sting), has audio, around 5 seconds</li>
