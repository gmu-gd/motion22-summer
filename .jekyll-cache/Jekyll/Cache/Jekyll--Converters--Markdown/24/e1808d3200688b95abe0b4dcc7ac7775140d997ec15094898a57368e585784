I":<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Design a moving poster for a real, future event that preferably is happening on campus or around campus. The design must retain the formal elements of a poster, communicate using the traditional rhetoric of a poster, and must scale to fit the portrait format (1080x1920). The choice of movement should feel natural and not distract from the content of the poster. The movement should emphasize the message of the poster not confuse the message.
The final poster will be printed and we will use the <a href="https://artivive.com/">Artivive</a> app to help with the AR version.</p>
