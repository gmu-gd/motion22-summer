<p>You can easily sequence you photographs in Photoshop following <a href="https://www.creativelysquared.com/article/how-to-turn-your-image-sequence-into-a-stop-motion-video">this tutorial</a>. I would recommend using the iMacs in the classroom to do this and depending on the amount of photographs you might want to do them in batches and then combine the videos in After Effects or Premiere.Â </p>
