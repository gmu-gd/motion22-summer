<p>Before jumping straight into the motion part of projects there needs to be a plan. Part of the plan will be a storyboard to show what the motion will be. Another part will be mood boards to show existing material of how the final piece might look and feel. The final part will be concept boards that show designs of the certain parts of the finished piece.</p>

<p>For this exercise you will use the storyboard we create in class as your plan and create a concept board for the title frame and include a mood board showing at least 5 images from other places of what the look and feel of the finished piece might be.</p>
