<p>Before jumping straight into the motion part of projects there needs to be a plan. Part of the plan will be a storyboard to show what the motion will be. Another part will be mood boards to show existing material of how the final piece might look and feel. The final part will be concept boards that show designs of the certain parts of the finished piece.</p>

<p>For this exercise you and a partner will create a storyboard, mood board, and a concept board for the idea we generated in class. The storyboard should include 20 panels with the first panel being the title of the film and the last panel being the credits (you and your partnerâ€™s names). The panels in between should tell a cohesive story making any relevant notes and considering all the different shot types we covered. The mood board should consist of at least 5 images that show the look and feel of your film pulled from existing things (films, design, art, photographs, etc.). There only needs to be one storyboard and one mood board but each of you in the pair will create your own concept board. The concept board should be your own design for what the title frame would look like. This should be influenced by the narrative shown on the storyboards as well as the images on the mood board.</p>
