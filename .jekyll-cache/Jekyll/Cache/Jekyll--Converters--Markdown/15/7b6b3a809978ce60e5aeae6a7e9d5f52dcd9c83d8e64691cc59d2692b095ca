<p>A simple way to start thinking about motion is through a gif, a short animated image that is controlled through individual frames. Your gif should be 600px by 300px at 72ppi and animate your name. Use only black on a transparent background. The gif should be at least 15 frames but can certainly be more and should loop seamlessly.</p>
