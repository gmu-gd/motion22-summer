#### Exercise 9: Stop Motion
Make the best stop motion film starring this banana. You have 2 hours. Submit your final video on Blackboard and upload it to our Vimeo group.

##### Technical Requirements
* Stop motion film
* Stars the banana
* Title card
* Audio if possible

##### Resources
You can easily sequence you photographs in Photoshop following [this tutorial](https://www.creativelysquared.com/article/how-to-turn-your-image-sequence-into-a-stop-motion-video). I would recommend using the iMacs in the classroom to do this and depending on the amount of photographs you might want to do them in batches and then combine the videos in After Effects or Premiere.Â
