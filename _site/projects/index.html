    <h4 id="exercise-6-type-in-motion">Exercise 6: Type in Motion</h4>
<p>Find a short bit of spoken audio. The audio could be from a movie, tv show, speech, etc. but should not have much background noise (so no music). Make a short animation that has the words come on and off screen timed to the audio track.</p>

<h5 id="technical-requirements">Technical Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>1920x1080</li>
  <li>Somewhere between 5 and 15 seconds</li>
  <li>Uses audio</li>

    <h4 id="exercise-5-poster-animation">Exercise 5: Poster Animation</h4>
<p>Recreate a Joseph Müller-Brockmann poster (<a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/4154#works">MoMA</a>, <a href="http://www.artnet.com/artists/josef-m%C3%BCller-brockmann/">artnet</a>, <a href="https://www.grapheine.com/en/history-of-graphic-design/graphic-designer-muller-brockmann-swiss-style">Grapheine</a>, <a href="https://www.internationalposter.com/exhibitions/mid-century-modern-the-posters-of-josef-muller-brockmann/">International Poster Gallery</a>, or you can download some images <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/93mz3dqum2kckik/AACvG4Y57cacxn6UcN-OYwsTa?dl=0">here</a>) as accurately as you can in Illustrator (1080x1920) and then animate it in After Effects. The posters are generally in German so you might not be able to read all the content but I would try to find out what kind of event the poster is promoting. Knowing the event might influence the motion of the poster. Your animation should enhance and bring the poster to life. More than likely the font is Akzidenz Grotesk.</p>

<h5 id="technical-requirements">Technical Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>1080x1920 (or dimensions close to that but keep the proportions of the original poster)</li>
  <li>As long as it needs to be</li>
  <li>As exact of a replica as you can make</li>
  <li>Only animate things that already exist on the poster</li>

    <h4 id="exercise-3-timing-pacing-narrative">Exercise 3: Timing, Pacing, Narrative</h4>
<p>Use found footage and the provided audio track to create a thirty second teaser trailer for a fictional film. Select clips that will introduce the settings, characters, and other moments of your fictional film that help tell the story. The footage should be thoughtfully curated but it is alright for the footage to be visually inconsistent as long as the teaser generally makes sense. Focus on gathering footage with different kinds of shots (extremely wide to extreme close up) but that all relate to the narrative you are trying to tell. The footage can be found at <a href="https://www.pexels.com/videos/">pexels.com</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have your selection of clips (shoot for around 20 clips initially), start to sequence and time them to the audio track. Keep the pacing of your clips in mind while timing them, some clips will be very short and others will last longer. The variety of pacing will help make the teaser more dynamic. The final teaser also needs to include the title of your fictional film. The title can be placed wherever you feel it belongs in the teaser but should fit in with the audio.</p>

<p>The final video should be exported as an mp4, uploaded to Vimeo, and added to the the Vimeo group. You should also submit your video on Blackboard.</p>

<h5 id="technical-requirements">Technical Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Uses full length of provided audio (linked on Blackboard)</li>
  <li>Title somewhere in the video</li>
  <li>Clips timed to audio when appropriate</li>
  <li>Various shot sizes</li>
  <li>Pace varies</li>
  <li>A (potentially very loose) narrative</li>

    <h4 id="exercise-2-making-a-plan">Exercise 2: Making a Plan</h4>
<p>Before jumping straight into the motion part of projects, there needs to be a plan. Part of the plan will be a storyboards that show key moments in the narrative along with thinking about pacing, shot selection, and motion. Another part will be mood boards uses existing imagery to show how the final piece might look and feel. The final part will be concept boards that show flat designs of the specific frames of the finished piece.</p>

<p>For this exercise you and a partner will create a storyboard, mood board, and a concept board for the idea we generated in class. The storyboard should include 20 panels with the first panel being the title of the film and the last panel being the credits (you and your partner’s names). The panels in between should tell a cohesive story making any relevant notes and considering all the different shot types we covered. The mood board should consist of at least 5 images that show the look and feel of your film pulled from existing things (films, design, art, photographs, etc.). You can also include some words on this page to describe the mood you are going for. There only needs to be one storyboard and one mood board but each of you in the pair will create your own concept board. The concept board should be your own design for what the title frame would look like. This should be influenced by the narrative shown on the storyboards as well as the images on the mood board.</p>

<p>Pick one of the following ideas for your storyboard:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Man steals persons wallet</li>
  <li>Stranded on an island</li>
  <li>Not enough money for ice cream</li>
  <li>Walking your dog and ran out of bags</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/assets/files/Plan-Template.pdf">Download the template for this exercise.</a></p>

<h5 id="technical-requirements">Technical Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>20 frame storyboard</li>
  <li>First frame is the title frame and the last frame is the credits frame</li>
  <li>1 mood board with at least 5 images</li>
  <li>1 concept board showing the title frame of the sequence. This should be done at 1920x1080 then added into the template</li>
  <li>All the above combined into the template</li>
</ul>

    <h4 id="exercise-1-dot-gif">Exercise 1: dot gif</h4>

<p>A simple way to start thinking about motion is through a gif, a short animated image that is controlled through individual frames. Your gif should be 600px by 300px at 72ppi and animate your name. Use only black on a transparent background. The gif should be at least 15 frames but can certainly be more and should loop seamlessly.</p>

<h5 id="technical-requirements">Technical Requirements</h5>

<ul>
  <li>600px by 300px at 72ppi</li>
  <li>15 frames (or more)</li>
  <li>your name animated</li>
  <li>seamless, infinite loop</li>
  <li>gif format</li>
  <li>transparent background</li>
  <li>only use black</li>
