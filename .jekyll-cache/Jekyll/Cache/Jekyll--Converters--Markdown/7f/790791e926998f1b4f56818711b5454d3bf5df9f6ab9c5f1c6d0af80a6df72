<p>Use found footage and the provided audio track to create a thirty second teaser trailer for a fictional film. Select clips that will introduce the settings, characters, and other moments of your fictional film that help tell the story. The footage should be thoughtfully curated but it is alright for the footage to be visually inconsistent as long as the teaser generally makes sense. Focus on gathering footage with different kinds of shots (extremely wide to extreme close up) but that all relate to the narrative you are trying to tell. The footage can be found at <a href="https://www.pexels.com/videos/">pexels.com</a>.</p>
